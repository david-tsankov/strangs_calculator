## Constructing a vector: When constructing a vector write the vector as a list of lists
e.g. A = [[1],[0],[0]], this represents the vector with components x=1, y=0, z=0. You can do this for n dimensions
e.g. A = [[1],[0],[0],....,[n]]

## Constructing a matrix: When constructing a matrix write the matrix once again as a list of lists, with each element of the mother list representing a sepparate row, and the number of elements in the daughter lists representing the number of columns. 
e.g. M = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], this represents a matrix of the form:  1 2 3 ----> list 1 
                                                                           4 5 6 ----> list 2
                                                                           7 8 9 ----> list 3
You can also do this for n-columns and m-rows.

To copy and paste from terminal when trying to use the name of an inverse matrix use SHIFT-CTRL-C and SHIFT-CTRL-V
